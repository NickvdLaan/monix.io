Concurrency bugs leave you restless? Monix Catnap provides a ton of
utilities that will let your worries take a good nap!

have a lot of useful features like Local, `ConcurrentQueue` and
`ConcurrentChannel` for everyone to use regardless of their effect of
choice.

they could be of use in your projects.
